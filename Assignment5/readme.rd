Instructions:
This is a trivia game inspired by jeopardy. 
I used the http://jervice.io/ API to create this game. 


The rules are fairly simple. 

1)Answer a question
2)Correct answers receive 100 points 
3)Incorrect answeers receive -100 points
4)A player only has 3 strikes before losing/resetting the game
5)Game is won by getting to 500 points

For testing/grading purposes I have added a For testing only section.
This provides a button that will provide the answer.
