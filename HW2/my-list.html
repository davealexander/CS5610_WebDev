           Mead is an ancient alcohol and is considered one of the first alchols to
           ever be discovered. It's ingredients are incredibly simple, water, yeast, and honey.
           Although easy to make, its falvors vary immensely due to the different type of flower varietals
        </p>

        <h2> Brewing Process </h2>
        <br>
            <img src="images/brewing.jpg">
            <p> The brewing process is a relatively easy process. Here are a few things you will need to begin brewing</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>One gallon of water</li>
                <li>Three pounds of honey</li>
                <li>2.5 grams of yeast</li>
                <li>Brewing grade glass container (carboy)</li>
                <li>Funnel</li>
                <li>Siphon</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> 
                Once those items have been acquired you can start brewing. Add the honey in to the carboy first, 
                then the water and then the yeast. Give it a shake so all the water and honey is mixed. Put a bung/stopper
                on the top of your carboy and let it sit for two weeks. Eventually you will take the mixture off of the yeast by
                putting the mixture in a new container and let it sit for a month or two until its ready. 
            </p>

            The most common mead is a traditional mead which has just water, honey and yeast.
            There are other types of meads called metheglins which contains spices. Another Variant
            is a braggot. Braggot's have the same ingredients as a traditional mead but use beer hops to give 
            it some citrusy flavors. There are many others but this is a quick introduction to mead.
